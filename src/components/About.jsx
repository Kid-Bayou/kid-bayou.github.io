          <p>
            Hey there, I’m Kidist. I have my Bachelor’s degree in Software
            Engineering and currently pursuing my Master’s to deepen my
            technical expertise. I’m curious about emerging technologies and I
            enjoy environments where learning and innovation collide. My passion
            lies in web dev but I’m always eager to dive into new tools,
            frameworks, or paradigms. When I’m not coding or studying, I enjoy
            reading and watching movies.
